Practice Agenda (for the last few practices)
*** BE FOCUSED
*** PAY ATTENTION BE PROCEDURE
*** NEED at least 8-10 Rubber bands calibrated for the SNE-state games
*** USE the side you will be doing skills at QCC
*** Need some one to video taping and timing

A. calibrate base shooter and fine tune auto_A
       ** it is also possible that rubber band (hardware) may need slight loosening or tightening
       ** as part of procedure rubberband should be cleaned and lubricated regularly
       ** rubber band also should be always mounted in a consistent way (fixed mount after calibration since we not doing lift)
    a. run Auto_A followed by 5-10 single shots
    b. collect the data and saved it as "rb_x_calib_y.txt" (x is number of rubber band; y is the number of calib test for the rubber band)
    c. push the data via github
    d. run matlab code to examine the data 
    e. modify the rbx_state.h heading file
       ** if may take a few iterations until you get the rubber band work
    f. fine tune auto_A: currently auto_A use AUTO_ADJUST, some minor changes to auto_A may be needed if it has consistency issue
    
B. verify short and mid range shooting 
    a. these are easy to calibrate, likely no need to collect data
    b. drive up to short/mid range, file a few shots
    c. make minor mod to the h file
    
C. Repeat A & B for the rest of rubber bands (do in 2-3 batches)

D. Calibrate auto_B and drive, pick up and repositioning game strategy
    a. run auto_B; some fine tuning of parameters (red, blue sides)
    b. drive around, grab, shot (practice skills to pick up red balls first, and only shot when you have 4 in position) time it to 50-60 seconds
    c. you have 45-55 seconds to move back, reposition, and shoot 28 balls (practice a strategy to reposition)
    
E. Test the magic_1() alignment.
    a. run auto_A, then make a couple of single shots
    b. hit the magic button to reposition
    c. fire a few more shots and reposition until perfect (record how to reposition)
    d. adjust the parameters
       ** notice robot may more during 32 shots -- magic_1() may need recali for skills
       ** come up a strategy to reduce robot movements in skills (a procedure that kind of lock robot in position)
    
F. Robot skills  -- key is the communication between loader and shooter
    a. single shots 32
    b. push magic_1 to reposition  (collect info for better magic_1 -- 
    c. single shots till time run out 
    
G. Fine tune program skills
    a. this is more difficult to tune because AUTO_ADJ, time to rest battery, reposition etc
    b. just take time, be patient ...
    
H. MORE PRACTICES
   auto_A followed by drive and pick balls and shot short range 
   auto_B followed by 50-60 seconds field and move back, reposition and shooting 
      good strategy to pick, shoot -- maximize field goals
      move to reposition and shoot
   robot_skills (communication between loader and shooter, and ball loading skills)
   program skills (fine tuning parameters based on robot skills)
